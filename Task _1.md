# Even or Odd Number Checker

## Description

This Python program checks whether a given integer number is **even** or **odd**.
It takes input from the user and uses the modulo (`%`) operator to determine the result.

---

##  How It Works

* The program asks the user to enter an integer number.
* It checks the remainder when the number is divided by 2.

  * If the remainder is `0`, the number is **even**.
  * Otherwise, the number is **odd**.
* The result is displayed using a formatted output.

## Code Explanation

```python
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
```

* Takes an integer input from the user.

```python
if num % 2 == 0:
```

* Checks if the number is divisible by 2.

```python
print(f"{num} is an even number.")
```

* Prints the result if the number is even.

```python
else:
    print(f"{num} is an odd number.")
```

* Prints the result if the number is odd.
